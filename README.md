# personal_web

Started: 2/24 ish

This is going to be my portfolio/website of my web development experience.

I'm disciplining myself to learn web development.


I'm currently not using any frameworks because I'd like to understand why the frameworks were needed.  So i'm starting with the basics.  Later I will include these frameworks and hopefully clean up my code.

I will be making projects later, but if you'd like to give me an idea for a basic project, feel free!

If you see things wrong with my code, please leave some feedback!


Goals: To be a better web developer and work at an educational company!
